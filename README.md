# SwiftUIDemo

SwiftUIDemo is a demo project built using the SwiftUI framework, following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. This project demonstrates how to make a clean and maintainable SwiftUI app focusing on modularity and reusable components.

> [!TIP]  
> I used macros from my `RJSwiftMacros` package. For more detailed information, see the [LINK](https://github.com/rezojoglidze/RJSwiftMacros).

## Features
- `SwiftUI Framework`: Utilizes SwiftUI to build declarative user interfaces.
- `MVVM Architecture`: Implements the MVVM design pattern to separate concerns and improve code organization.
- `RJSwiftMacros`: Leverages custom macros, particularly RJSwiftMacros, to reduce boilerplate code and enhance development efficiency.
- `Networking`: Implements network requests using URLSession with Swift's async/await for modern asynchronous programming.
