# SwiftUIDemo

SwiftUIDemo is a demo project built using the SwiftUI framework, following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. This project demonstrates how to build a clean and maintainable SwiftUI app with a focus on modularity and reusable components.

> [!TIP]  
> Here I Used several macros from my package `RJSwiftMacros`. For more detailed information about it see the [LINK](https://github.com/rezojoglidze/RJSwiftMacros).

## Features
- `SwiftUI Framework`: Utilizes SwiftUI for building declarative user interfaces.
- `MVVM Architecture`: Implements the MVVM design pattern to separate concerns and improve code organization.
- `RJSwiftMacros`: Leverages custom macros, particularly RJSwiftMacros, to reduce boilerplate code and enhance development efficiency.
- `Networking`: Implements network requests using URLSession with Swift's async/await for modern asynchronous programming.
